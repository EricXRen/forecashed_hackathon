# Hackathon 2022

## Background:
AutoML: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide#tabular


## Dataset:

### Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.It is used to track website activity such as landing page, session duration, pages per session and the bounce rate of individuals using the site, along with the information on the source of the traffic. Google Analytics is the most widely used (> 65%) website statistics service.




## Goal:
1. Simple forecast using AutoML 
	baseline: preparing data, train a model and do evaluation, batch forecast
	stretch goal: visualisation or deploy to end point 

2. Building a recommender system using Google Analytics data
	baseline: using BigQuery ML, train, evaluate and deploy in a pipeline
	stretch goal: Using Deep Learning NN to do it and deploy in a pipeline, comparing the result with BigQuery.
